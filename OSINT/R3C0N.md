As challenge suggest ud **Author will help**. So I search for author social media profiles ( ex: Instagram, Twitter, LikdeIn, etc...) But I find find nothing there. So I search for r3curs1v3_pr0xy in the github search. It shows me a user. I go to it's profile but there is nothing there also. I check the repo the user have but it have only one repo and flag is also not there i checked all the commit. But after sometime I think to check all the option then in very repo we have a wiki page and this the when i found something but it is base64 after decoding it I got the flag.
